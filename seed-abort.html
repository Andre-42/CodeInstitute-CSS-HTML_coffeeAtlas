        <h3 id="structure">The cherry - An incubator for the coffee bean.</h3>
        <p>
            Coffee is a fruit - an extremely precious fruit. It takes at least 200 coffee cherries to brew the 50 ounce
            pot of coffee you enjoy each day. Each cherry contains two coffee beans [seeds] which take up the central
            space of
            the cherry. Within each coffee bean you will also find an embryo. This is the coffee baby plant. Once you
            plant the seed and it gets sufficient water, the embryo awakens. At that stage it starts degrading the
            coffee bean surrounding it to release its nutrients at a rapid pace to be able to grow into a proper small
            sidling with green leaves. Once that is done it can use its roots and the first leafs to grow on its own
            using the sun and the nutrients in the soil.
            So you see what we use to make the coffee we enjoy in the morning are the resources the embryo would use to
            initiate growth. You can see inside the coffee cherry using MRI as you can see in the video below.

        <p>
            Coffee in general is sensible to environmental changes, diseases and pests that plaque tropical farms.
            Multiple insects and bugs can invest coffee plantations by eating away foliage, fruits or root stock. Such
            examples are the Coffee Leaf Miner &#40;<i>Leucoptera coffeella Guer</i>&#41;, the Root Mealybug or the
            Coffee Berry Borer &#40;<i>Hypothenemus hampei</i>&#41;.
            Diseases originate predominately in fungal infections of leafs, roots and fruits. In those cases the fungus
            divertes nutrients away from the growing fruits to help its own growth. Here are some of the most common
            diseases found in coffee. You can find out more at <a
                href="https://wikifarmer.com/coffee-major-pest-and-diseases-and-control-measures/">Wikifarmer</a>.
        </p>
        <h4>
            Coffee leaf rust
        </h4>
        <p>
            Scientifically known as &#40;<i>Hemileia vastatrix Berk & Broome</i>&#41;, this fungal disease affects
            coffee plants and causes
            yellow-orange spots on the leaves, which lead to defoliation and decreased coffee production. In addition,
            it does not
            allow the coffee berries to ripen at the same pace, which makes it take longer to collect the crop. The
            yellow spots
            under the leaves are dusty spores that disseminate quickly, especially in warm climates. It is spread by
            windborne
            spores of the fungus climate change, and increased global trade has led to its spread worldwide. I have
            mentioned it in
            previous articles, as the impact has been huge in recent years, and no coffee plantation worldwide is exempt
            from its
            threat.
        </p>
        <h4>
            American Leaf spot of coffee &#40;<i>Mycena tricolor</i>&#41;
        </h4>
        <p>
            This is found in coffee plantations above 700 m altitude, where there is an excess of shadow and a high
            humidity level
            with fresh temperatures. It provokes damage to the plant&#39;s branches, fruits, and leaves. Its
            dissemination is slow. Dark
            brown circular injuries that later turn light brown are a clear sign of this disease. The plant eventually
            loses an
            excessive amount of foliage, reducing its ability to photosynthesize.
        </p>
        <h4>
            Coffee berry disease, CBD &#40;<i>Colletotrichum sp.</i>&#41;
        </h4>
        <p>
            This species of the fungal disease affects mainly Arabica species, and even though Robusta has shown high
            resistance
            levels, it is not entirely immune to this disease. Different variants appear throughout the countries where
            coffee is
            cultivated. This fungus might appear in the stems, the leaves, and the coffee varieties when they are not
            ripe &#40;green
            berries&#41;. In advanced stages, the coffee Berries dry out and acquire a dark color. It is believed that
            plantations with
            low levels of fertilization and low soil moisture are more susceptible to this disease.

        <h4>
            Cercospora Leaf Spot &#40;<i>Cercospora coffeicola</i>&#41;
        </h4>
        <p>
            This fungal disease occurs in coffee plantations that lack proper nutrient balance. It spreads through wind
            and rain
            splash and thrives in humid and warm environments. The symptoms can be observed in newly generated leaves
            and tissue,
            appearing as brown spots that start at the edges of the coffee leaves and spread toward the center. The
            disease can also
            be seen on the branches, starting at the spots where leaves have fallen.

        <h3 id="starvation">It all comes down to starvation!</h3>
        <p>
            You can see that it is not about damage sustained by these pests and diseases but rather about taking away
            nutrients that should fill up the embryo&#39;s pantry, i.e. the coffee bean.
            Here you can see how that works out in real life. This coffee tree had a fungal infection. As you can see
            the cherry does look mostly normal from the outside. However MRI revealed that the coffee cherry actually
            controlled the nutrient supply to its 2 seeds in a way that it shut down access to nutrients for one of them
            to allow the other seed to grow normally.
            In essence one seed was aborted. You can see the effect on the storage tissue as it is just a desintegrated
            skeletal structure with little storage compounds remaining.
