        <p>
            At approximately 3 to 4 years of age, coffee plants enter the reproductive or mature stage, which is when
            they begin to flower and produce fruit.
            The fruits, known as coffee cherries, then begin to develop from the fertilized flowers.
            You can choose a specific compound from the list below to see how it is distributed within the fertilized
            flower bud.

        <p>
            The fruit development stage is a crucial part of the coffee growth cycle. Coffee cherries typically
            take between 6 to 9
            months to ripen, depending on the variety and environmental conditions. Initially, the cherries are
            green, but as they
            ripen, they turn yellow, then red, and finally a deep crimson. Each cherry usually contains two
            coffee beans, although a
            single-bean variant known as a peaberry sometimes occurs.
            As you can see one and a half months into the seed development the berry is growing and still has a
            long ways to go.
