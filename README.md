## General Intent
The Coffee Atlas is a web platform designed to introduce students and interested people to the world of plant biology and chemistry, with a focus on coffee cultivation. This page has been created as a learning resource for students, as well as for anyone with an interest in understanding the intricate processes that go into growing coffee.

### Features
- **Interactive Learning:** The Coffee Atlas offers an engaging learning experience. It prompts users with a thought-provoking question, "How long does it take to make a cup of coffee?" to spark curiosity and set the stage for exploration.

- **Informative Content:** The platform provides concise and accessible information about the biology and chemistry of coffee plants. Users can delve into topics like sugar transport, cell wall processing, and protein features related to coffee growth and disease response during development.

- **Visual Presentation:** I use visual aids, images, video and well-structured content to enhance the learning experience. The website is designed with clarity and user-friendliness in mind.

- **Accessibility:** Coffee Atlas is accessible to all users, ensuring that knowledge about plant biology and chemistry is within reach for everyone. To this end topics are only presented in simple terms without diving to deep into the science.

- **Future Intent:** This website is intended to give researchers and others who would be interested in creating a much more comprahensible repository for image based plant science a chance to reach out to myself and my colleagues at the IPK through links in the footer.

### Usage

1. Visit the [Coffee Atlas website](https://andre-42.github.io/CodeInstitute-CSS-HTML_coffeeAtlas/).
2. Explore the introductory question and the topics related to coffee growth.
3. Engage with the content and enrich your understanding of plant biology and chemistry.
4. Contact us (me or the IPK) through the links provided to get involved.

### Color Scheme

As this website is about the coffee plant, I wanted to stick to green colors to keep the color scheme relevant.

In my css file I used the following colors to represent that theme:

![The Plant Atlas Color Scheme](documentation/color-palette.png)

* I have used '#ecfdcc' as a backgound color & '#2C3A0E' as a contrasting primary color used in the main body text.
* The header uses the fallback color '#0c950c' but uses a background image in its standard implementation.
* The footer uses the same background image. However uses a darker background color '#014901' as fallback. This is the same background color as for the navigation bar to frame the main section.
* Buttons, hovered divs and dropdown segments of the menubar are colored '#016401' to present a slight contrast.
* The current button/menu segment of the navbar that represents the html that is currently visited is highlighted in '#9ACD32'.
* The alternative text color used on dark backgrounds is '#f5f5f5'.
