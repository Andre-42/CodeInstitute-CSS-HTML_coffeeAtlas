        <h3 id="structure">The cherry - An incubator for the coffee bean.</h3>
        <p>
            Coffee is a fruit - an extremely precious fruit. It takes at least 200 coffee cherries to brew the 50 ounce
            pot of coffee you enjoy each day. Each cherry contains two coffee beans &#40;seeds&#41; which take up the
            central
            space of
            the cherry. Within each coffee bean you will also find an embryo. This is the coffee baby plant. Once you
            plant the seed and it gets sufficient water, the embryo awakens. At that stage it starts degrading the
            coffee bean surrounding it to release its nutrients at a rapid pace to be able to grow into a proper small
            sidling with green leaves. Once that is done it can use its roots and the first leafs to grow on its own
            using the sun and the nutrients in the soil.
            So you see what we use to make the coffee we enjoy in the morning are the resources the embryo would use to
            initiate growth. You can see inside the coffee cherry using MRI as you can see in the video below.

            <p>
                Coffee in general is sensible to environmental changes, diseases and pests that plaque tropical farms.
                Multiple insects and bugs can invest coffee plantations by eating away foliage, fruits or root stock. Such
                examples are the Coffee Leaf Miner &#40;<em>Leucoptera coffeella Guer</em>&#41;, the Root Mealybug or the
                Coffee Berry Borer &#40;<em>Hypothenemus hampei</em>&#41;.
                Diseases originate predominately in fungal infections of leafs, roots and fruits. In those cases the fungus
                divertes nutrients away from the growing fruits to help its own growth. Here are some of the most common
                diseases found in coffee. You can find out more at <a

            <p>
                Scientifically known as &#40;<em>Hemileia vastatrix Berk & Broome</em>&#41;, this fungal disease affects
                coffee plants and causes
                yellow-orange spots on the leaves, which lead to defoliation and decreased coffee production. In addition,
                it does not
                allow the coffee berries to ripen at the same pace, which makes it take longer to collect the crop. The
                yellow spots
                under the leaves are dusty spores that disseminate quickly, especially in warm climates. It is spread by
                windborne
                spores of the fungus climate change, and increased global trade has led to its spread worldwide. I have
                mentioned it in
                previous articles, as the impact has been huge in recent years, and no coffee plantation worldwide is exempt
                from its
                threat.

                This is found in coffee plantations above 700 m altitude, where there is an excess of shadow and a high
                humidity level
                with fresh temperatures. It provokes damage to the plant&#39;s branches, fruits, and leaves. Its
                dissemination is slow. Dark
                brown circular injuries that later turn light brown are a clear sign of this disease. The plant eventually
                loses an
                excessive amount of foliage, reducing its ability to photosynthesize.

                This species of the fungal disease affects mainly Arabica species, and even though Robusta has shown high
                resistance
                levels, it is not entirely immune to this disease. Different variants appear throughout the countries where
                coffee is
                cultivated. This fungus might appear in the stems, the leaves, and the coffee varieties when they are not
                ripe &#40;green
                berries&#41;. In advanced stages, the coffee Berries dry out and acquire a dark color. It is believed that
                plantations with
                low levels of fertilization and low soil moisture are more susceptible to this disease.

                This fungal disease occurs in coffee plantations that lack proper nutrient balance. It spreads through wind
                and rain
                splash and thrives in humid and warm environments. The symptoms can be observed in newly generated leaves
                and tissue,
                appearing as brown spots that start at the edges of the coffee leaves and spread toward the center. The
                disease can also
                be seen on the branches, starting at the spots where leaves have fallen.

        <h3 id="starvation">It all comes down to starvation!</h3>
        <p>
            You can see that it is not about damage sustained by these pests and diseases but rather about taking
            away
            nutrients that should fill up the embryo&#39;s pantry, i.e. the coffee bean.
            Here you can see how that works out in real life. This coffee tree had a fungal infection. As you can
            see
            the cherry does look mostly normal from the outside. However MRI revealed that the coffee cherry
            actually
            controlled the nutrient supply to its 2 seeds in a way that it shut down access to nutrients for one of
            them
            to allow the other seed to grow normally.
            In essence one seed was aborted. You can see the effect on the storage tissue as it is just a
            desintegrated
            skeletal structure with little storage compounds remaining.

                    As you can see this data about the failed seed indicates that some mechanism stopped nutrient supply to the
                    seed. The transport sugras tell us that there is none delivered to the failed seed or can not be
                    accumulated. The intermediate storage compounds are also missing and the long term storage within the cell
                    walls is largely degraded. Overall this looks like starvation after the seed was cut off from the maternal
                    tissue. The 3D reproduction only shows a degenerated shape in place of the second seed. The Protein II
                    signiture together with the higher signal for cell wall degredation products again indicate that the bad
                    seed is eating itself.

                <p>
                    In this picture you can see a reconstruction of the veins that deliver nutrients to the seed in green. As
                    you can see they form a cord like structure along the center of the coffee cherry. If you want to compare it
                    to the other images that is right between the 2 seeds. If you want to look again at the transport sugar
                    image you can see a more yellowish color indicating higher concentrations. You should now clearly be able to
                    see that nothing gets to the aborted seed. You might thing why is the plant doing this? It is simply damage
                    control.
