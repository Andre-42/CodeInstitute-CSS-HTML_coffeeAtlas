Testing was ongoing throughout the entire build. I utilised Chrome developer tools whilst building to pinpoint and troubleshoot any issues as I went along.

During development I made use of google developer tools to ensure everything was working correctly and to assist with troubleshooting when things were not working as expected.

I have gone through each page using google chrome developer tools.

## AUTOMATED TESTING

### W3C Validator

[W3C](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to validate the HTML on all pages of the website. It was also used to validate the CSS.

* [index.html](documentation/W3C-index-validation.png) - Passed.
* [seed-abort.html](documentation/W3C-seed-abort-validation.png) - Passed.

* [style.css](documentation/css-validator.png) - Passed, no errors found.

### Lighthouse

I used Lighthouse within the Chrome Developer Tools to test the performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO of the website.

### Desktop Results

Each page is achieving a score of 100 for accessibility and best practise. All other parameters score 90 or above.
