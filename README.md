# General intent
This page was created as a learning platform for students and general people that are interested in biology and chemistry of plants. The side gives a short introduction to the topic of growing Coffee by asking the Reader how long it takes to make a cup of coffee.

The site has been checked by Lighthouse accesibility and by the HTML and CSS Validator.
Minor issues were found as a result of responsive design. However I was not able to edit the html and css files through the IDE platform after deployment.
# Features
- A static Header and Navigation bar at the top of the page. The H1 and H2 header have a photographic background.
- The Main Menu links to HTML pages (index.html and a content html) as well as the footer through the contect-link in the navigation bar.

- hovering changes the color of the applicable menu field to a lighter green, while the active side is highlited by lime green.

- hovering above the active side menu field will activate a dropdown menu to access short cuts to different chapters on the current side.
- the navigation bar will switch between horizontal and vertical alignment depending on the screen size.

- multiple images of coffee fruits, coffee related diseases are iterated with text based information. When open source thirdparty content (diseases) was used the original website can be reached by hyperlinks within the chapter headings.

- an interactive dropdown menu enables the user to load different images to a case study appropriate to the written text.

# Case study content
- case study content is part of my research work conducted at the IPK Gatersleben (www.ipk-gatersleben.de) over the last 3 years and has been presented by my previously at conferences.

## Bugs
# Solved
- most bugs related to formating issues and a tendency to make it too complex for just html and css. JS was used in one instance to load selected images by the user.

# Unsolved
- minor issues still exist in the formating at msartphone screen sizes. Time constraints and trouble with cloud IDE averted the correction after a first deployment. I currently can't access repositories with codeanywhere.

One issue is the Z-indexing and position of the footer (inaccessible) and one background color field which is to far in the foreground.

## Validator Testing
# HTML

Warning: Consider adding a lang attribute to the html start tag to declare the language of this document.

Error: Element head is missing a required instance of child element title.

From line 1, column 1; to line 1, column 61

https://andre-42.github.io/CodeInstitute-CSS-HTML_coffeeAtlas/

Content model for element head:
If the document is an iframe srcdoc document or if title information is available from a higher-level protocol: Zero or more elements of metadata content, of which no more than one is a title element and no more than one is a base element.
Otherwise: One or more elements of metadata content, of which exactly one is a title element and no more than one is a base element.

I didn*t find the mentioned issues in the html code, maybe these are misidentified.

# CSS
